I have to make a basic version of Hearthstone where you play with an AI (multiplayer is optional). 
This is an school project and i need help with the back-end. Front-ent is almost good. 

Laguages to be used: HTML5, Vanilla Javascript (no jquery or any other lib/framework), CSS, Java, SQL
for server connection i have implimented javalin and jackson. the script file from sql is in the folder Database.
